    <h3>1998 to 2001 - Joseph Estrada's Presidency and EDSA II</h3>

    <p>
        Joseph Estrada, a former actor turned populist politician, became president
        in 1998, winning with a wide margin. His administration initially focused
        on poverty alleviation and rural development but was soon engulfed in scandals,
        including allegations of plunder. Estrada faced impeachment in 2000 after a
        whistleblower accused him of receiving millions of pesos in <b>illegal gambling
        payoffs</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The trial was halted when senators allied with Estrada voted against opening
        incriminating evidence, triggering mass protests. This culminated in <b>EDSA II</b>,
        a peaceful revolution from January 17–20, 2001, led by civil society groups,
        students, and military factions. Estrada was forced to resign, and Vice
        President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo assumed the presidency.

    <h3>2001 - EDSA II</h3>

    <p>
        EDSA II, from <b>January 17–20, 2001</b>, toppled Joseph Estrada's presidency
        following allegations of corruption and plunder. Unlike EDSA I, which
        united a broad coalition, EDSA II was driven primarily by middle-class
        protests and civil society, with significant military involvement. Estrada
        was forced to resign, paving the way for Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's presidency.

    <h3>2001 - EDSA III</h3>

    <p>
        EDSA III occurred in <b>May 2001</b>, shortly after Estrada's arrest.
        Estrada's supporters, largely from marginalized sectors, rallied for
        his release and demanded Arroyo's resignation. Violent clashes marked
        this uprising, which was less peaceful and less supported by elites
        compared to the previous revolutions.

    <h3>2001 to 2010 - Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's Administration</h3>

    <p>
        Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's presidency was marked by economic growth,
        focusing on policies that promoted exports, infrastructure, and the IT
        industry. However, her administration faced allegations of election
        fraud in the <b>"Hello Garci" scandal</b> during the 2004 presidential elections.
    </p>

    <p>
        Arroyo also survived <b>EDSA III</b> in May 2001, a protest largely composed
        of Estrada supporters demanding her resignation. Although less
        peaceful than EDSA I and II, it showcased the enduring political
        divide among Filipinos. Despite controversies, Arroyo launched the
        <b>Strong Republic Nautical Highway</b> to improve trade connectivity and tourism.
