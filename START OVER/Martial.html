        <p>
          Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law, which gave him control
          over the country. Many people lost their rights, and corruption grew.
          Protests increased, especially after the killing of Benigno Aquino Jr.
          in 1983. The People Power Revolution in 1986 ended Marcosâ€™ rule and
          restored democracy.

  <h3>1972 - Declaration of Martial Law</h3>

  <p>
    On <b>September 21, 1972</b>, President Ferdinand Marcos declared
    Martial Law under <b>Proclamation No. 1081</b>, citing threats from

    <b>Senator Benigno Aquino Jr.</b>, were arrested. This period saw increased
    militarization and the emergence of "crony capitalism," benefiting Marcos' allies.
