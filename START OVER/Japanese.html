        <p>
          During World War II, the Philippines endured Japanese occupation
          marked by brutal events like the Bataan Death March. Filipinos
          resisted through guerilla warfare, and General MacArthur’s return
          in 1944 led to liberation. The war’s aftermath led to independence in 1946.

  <h3>1941 - The Attack on Pearl Harbor and Expansion</h3>

  <p>
    The attack on <b>Pearl Harbor</b> on <b>December 7, 1941</b>, by Japanese forces
    marked the official entry of the United States into <b>World War II</b>.
    This attack not only demonstrated Japan's military ambitions but
    also set the stage for the Pacific theater's intensification.
    Given the Philippines' strategic location, it became a critical
    battleground shortly after the U.S. declaration of war.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under the command of <b>General Douglas MacArthur</b>, the <b>United States
    Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE)</b> mobilized both American and
    Filipino troops to defend the islands. Filipino soldiers, who
    composed the majority of the forces, displayed resilience despite
    being outmatched in resources and firepower. However, Japan's swift
    and calculated offensives overwhelmed the defenses. This rapid
    advancement resulted in the fall of key locations, including the
    capital, Manila, which was declared an open city to minimize civilian casualties.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Japanese occupation began shortly thereafter, marking a
    period of significant hardship for the Filipino people. The
    occupation disrupted daily life, brought widespread atrocities,
    and intensified the Filipino resistance movement, setting the
    stage for future liberation efforts (Agoncillo, 1990, pp. 365–366).

  <h3>1942 - The Fall of the Philippines</h3>

  <p>
    The year 1942 marked a devastating period for the Philippines during
    World War II as Japanese forces overcame the combined strength of
    American and Filipino defenders in the <b>Battle of Bataan</b>. After
    months of relentless fighting and dwindling supplies, the USAFFE troops,
    already weakened by disease, starvation, and exhaustion, were forced to
    surrender on <b>April 9, 1942</b>. This defeat resulted in one of the darkest
    chapters of the war: the <b>Bataan Death March</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over <b>76,000 American and Filipino soldiers</b> were taken prisoner and
    forced to march approximately <b>60 miles from Mariveles, Bataan, to
    Capas, Tarlac</b>. Along the way, the captives endured severe physical
    abuse, lack of food and water, and extreme heat. Those who fell
    behind or attempted to escape were brutally executed. It is estimated
    that thousands died during the march due to these inhumane conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bataan Death March not only exemplified the harshness of Japanese
    occupation but also became a symbol of Filipino and American suffering,
    resilience, and eventual determination to liberate the country.
    Despite this tragedy, resistance efforts within the Philippines
    grew stronger, laying the groundwork for future guerrilla movements
    against Japanese forces (Agoncillo, 1990, pp. 366–367).

  <h3>1943 - Occupation and Resistance</h3>

  <p>
    In 1943, Japan solidified its hold on the Philippines by establishing
    a puppet government under the leadership of <b>José P. Laurel</b>.
    Although Laurel assumed the presidency, his cooperation with the
    Japanese was largely seen as a reluctant act under duress, aimed
    at protecting Filipino lives and minimizing the extent of Japan's
    oppressive policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, resistance movements against Japanese rule flourished
    across the archipelago. These guerrilla groups, composed of both
    civilian volunteers and former USAFFE soldiers, conducted strategic
    ambushes, sabotage missions, and espionage operations against
    Japanese forces. The <b>Hukbalahap (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon)</b>,
    one of the most prominent resistance groups, exemplified the
    Filipino people's determination to oppose the occupation. These
    efforts demonstrated widespread defiance and played a critical
    role in maintaining morale and supporting Allied intelligence
    operations (Agoncillo, 1990, pp. 368–369).

  <h3>1944 - The Return of MacArthur</h3>

  <p>
    A significant turning point in the war occurred on <b>October 20, 1944</b>,
    when General Douglas MacArthur made his historic landing on the
    shores of <b>Leyte</b>, fulfilling his iconic promise: "I shall return."
    This marked the beginning of the Allied campaign to liberate the
    Philippines. The subsequent <b>Battle of Leyte Gulf</b>, one of the largest
    naval battles in history, decisively weakened the Japanese navy.
    This Allied victory not only paved the way for the liberation of the
    Philippines but also marked the decline of Japan's strategic presence
    in the Pacific (Agoncillo, 1990, p. 370).

  <h3>1945 - Liberation, Reconstruction, and the End of Japanese Occupation</h3>

  <p>
    The final months of the war saw intense battles aimed at liberating
    the Philippines from Japanese control. <b>The Battle of Manila</b> in early
    1945 was particularly devastating, resulting in the near-total
    destruction of the capital and significant civilian casualties.
    Despite these losses, the Allied forces successfully liberated Manila
    and the rest of the Philippines.
  </p>

  <p>
    Japan's formal surrender in <b>September 1945</b> marked the end of four
    brutal years of occupation. The war left the Philippines in ruins,
    with its economy shattered and infrastructure devastated.
    Reconstruction efforts began immediately, as the country prepared
    for the transition to independence. The resilience shown during this
    period became a defining characteristic of the Filipino spirit (Agoncillo, 1990, pp. 370–372).
