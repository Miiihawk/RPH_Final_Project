                        <h3>500,000 BC – 5000 BC - Ancient Settlements</h3>
                        <p>The earliest human presence in the Philippines dates back approximately 500,000 years, as
                            evidenced by the discovery of the fossilized remains of Homo luzonensis in Callao Cave,
                            Cagayan in 2019.
                            This new species, distinct from Homo sapiens and Homo erectus, showcases unique features,
                            such as curved fingers adapted for climbing, suggesting a blend of arboreal and terrestrial
                            living.
                            Other archaeological discoveries, like stone tools in the Rizal, Kalinga excavation site,
                            provide insights into early tool-making and hunting practices in the region. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Tabon Caves in Palawan, excavated in the 1960s, revealed some of the earliest human tools
                            and remains, including the Tabon Man, estimated to be 22,000 years old.
                            These findings point to advanced knowledge of stone tool-making and possibly early forms of
                            communal living. </p>

                        <h3>2000 BC - 500 AD - Austronesian Migration</h3>
                        <p>Around 2000 BC, Austronesian-speaking people from Taiwan began migrating to the Philippines
                            via maritime routes.
                            This migration introduced agriculture, domesticated animals, and pottery, marking the
                            transition from hunter-gatherer societies to agrarian communities.
                            These Austronesians brought a sophisticated maritime culture, reflected in the design of
                            balangay boats, which became integral to inter-island trade and travel.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The Austronesians are also credited with introducing rice cultivation, tattooing, weaving,
                            and the early concept of barangay governance.
                            Over time, these settlers intermingled with indigenous populations, creating a rich tapestry
                            of linguistic, cultural, and genetic diversity.

                        <p>Discovered in 1989 near the Lumban River in Laguna, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription (LCI)
                            is the oldest written document in the Philippines.
                            Dated to 900 AD, the inscription is written in Kawi script, a writing system derived from
                            Old Javanese, and reveals a sophisticated society with developed legal and trade systems.

                            It references nearby places such as Paila (Bulacan) and Medang (Java), indicating extensive
                            regional trade and cultural exchange with neighboring Southeast Asian policies.

                        <p>
                            During this period, barangays, small, independent communities led by a datu or chieftain,
                            became the dominant form of governance.
                            These communities, typically consisting of 30–100 households, were often located near
                            rivers, coasts, or fertile lands.
                            The barangays were social and political units based on kinship, trade alliances, and mutual
                            protection.

                        <p>
                            In Mindanao and Sulu, Islam was introduced by Arab and Malay traders around the 13th
                            century.
                            By the 14th century, Islam had taken root, leading to the establishment of Sultanates in
                            Sulu (1450) and Maguindanao (1515).
                            These sultanates became powerful Islamic centers, with rulers like Sultan Sharif ul-Hashim
                            consolidating power and spreading Islamic teachings.

                            The Philippines was an active participant in trade networks connecting Southeast Asia,
                            China, India, and the Malay Peninsula.
                            Chinese records from the Song Dynasty (960–1279) refer to regular trade with the “Ma-i”
                            (believed to be Mindoro), which exported beeswax, cotton, and gold in exchange for ceramics
                            and silk.
                            Archaeological evidence, such as Ming Dynasty ceramics and gold artifacts from Surigao,
                            confirms the flourishing trade economy.

                            The discovery of the Butuan Boats, dated to the 4th–13th centuries, highlights the region’s
                            advanced shipbuilding skills and its role in maritime trade.
                            Butuan was known as a major trading port, particularly for its gold, which remains some of
                            the finest ever unearthed in Southeast Asia.
