    <h3>1899–1902 - Philippine-American War</h3>

    <p>
        The Philippine-American War started on February 4, 1899, after fighting broke out between Filipino and American
        soldiers near Manila.
        Filipino leader Emilio Aguinaldo, who had worked with the Americans to fight Spain, opposed the Treaty of Paris.
        This treaty gave the Philippines to the United States without consulting Filipinos, who had been fighting for
        independence
    </p>

    <p>
        At first, the war involved large battles, but Filipino forces later used guerrilla tactics, relying on surprise
        attacks and knowledge of the land.
        In response, the U.S. military used strict measures, like moving Filipino civilians into “zones of protection”
        under American control.
        These zones were often overcrowded, with poor conditions that caused suffering and disease.
    </p>

    <p>
        American troops faced challenges, including difficult terrain, tropical diseases, and the determination of
        Filipino fighters.
        Still, they slowly gained control using better weapons and strategies.
        A major turning point was the capture of Aguinaldo on March 23, 1901, by U.S. forces under General Frederick
        Funston.
        After this, organized Filipino resistance weakened.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even after the war officially ended in 1902, some groups in remote areas continued to resist.
        The war had a lasting effect on both the Philippines and the United States, shaping the relationship between the
        two countries for years to come.

    <h3>1901 - Establishment of Civil Government</h3>

    <p>
        After Aguinaldo’s capture, the U.S. establishes a civil government in the Philippines, appointing William Howard
        Taft as the first Governor-General.
        Taft focuses on infrastructure, public education, and economic development while asserting U.S. sovereignty.
        The elite’s cooperation with colonial authorities becomes critical in this phase.

    </p>

    <p>
        These changes were meant to show the Americans as helpful rulers, but many Filipinos were unhappy.
        They felt the civil government was still colonial rule and wanted independence. This tension would continue in
        the years ahead.

<!--1902 - Philippine Organic Act-->

<div class="popup" id="popup4">

    <h3>1902 - Philippine Organic Act</h3>

    <p>
        In 1902, after American forces suppressed a Filipino independence movement, the U.S.
        Congress passed the Philippine Organic Act, also known as the Philippine Bill of 1902, to establish civilian
        control over the islands.
        The act created a framework for governance by setting up a civil government in the Philippines and replacing
        military rule. It provided for a Philippine Commission, which acted as the legislative body, and included
        provisions for an elected Filipino assembly.
        While the Organic Act allowed for some Filipino participation in government, it still maintained significant
        American control over the islands.
    </p>

    <p>
        Among its provisions, the act allowed for two Filipino resident commissioners to represent the Philippines in
        the U.S. Congress.
        These commissioners began their terms in 1907. While the Organic Act was a step toward political participation
        for Filipinos,
        it continued to reinforce the dominance of the American administration and the local elite, while limiting the
        power of the general population.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Philippine Organic Act was replaced by the Jones Act in 1916, which promised eventual independence and
        expanded Filipino political participation.
        The Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934 further paved the way for the Philippines' sovereignty, culminating in full
        independence in 1946.

    <h3>1903–1908 - Public Education System</h3>

    <p>
        The United States introduced a public education system in the Philippines following its acquisition of the
        islands, with English as the medium of instruction.
        This system was designed not only to provide basic education but also to instill American values and ideals in
        Filipino students, creating a cultural foundation for American influence.
        The U.S. government aimed to shape Filipino society by promoting English, American democratic principles, and
        ideals of individualism and civic responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        A key component of the education policy was the <b>Pensionado Program</b>, which sent select Filipino students
        to the United States for higher education.
        These students, often from the elite or influential families, were expected to return to the Philippines and use
        their education to help reinforce American colonial objectives.
        As a result, this program helped cultivate a pro-American elite that played a significant role in shaping the
        political and social landscape of the Philippines during the colonial period.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to shaping the educational system, the U.S. also took steps to modernize public schooling, which had
        been underdeveloped during Spanish rule.
        The Bureau of Public Schools was established in 1901 to oversee the implementation of the new system, and
        teachers, called Thomasites, were sent from the U.S. to train Filipino educators.
        However, challenges persisted, as the Philippines faced issues such as inadequate school facilities, regional
        disparities,
        and a shortage of qualified teachers the public education system laid the foundation for the rise of a new
        generation of educated Filipinos, which would later play an important role in the country’s pursuit of
        independence.

    <h3>1916 - Jones Act (Philippine Autonomy Act)</h3>

    <p>
        The<b>Jones Law</b><i>(also known as the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916)</i> was a key piece of legislation
        passed by the U.S. Congress, signaling a commitment to the eventual independence of the Philippines.
        While it did not grant immediate independence, the law promised that the Philippines would become independent
        once a "stable government" was established.
        This act marked a shift in U.S. policy toward greater self-governance for Filipinos, reflecting the growing
        demands for independence.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the most significant provisions of the Jones Act was the establishment of an <b>elected Philippine
        Senate</b>, which replaced the previously appointed Philippine Commission.
        The Senate, together with the existing House of Representatives, formed the <b>Philippine Legislature</b>,
        greatly expanding Filipino political participation.
        This move was designed to give Filipinos a larger role in shaping the laws and governance of their country,
        although the U.S. still maintained oversight over certain aspects, including foreign policy and defense.

    </p>

    <p>
        The Jones Act also emphasized the role of Filipinos in preparing for full independence by fostering the
        development of a stable and democratic government.
        Despite the increased autonomy, U.S. control remained significant, and the Philippines continued to be under
        American sovereignty until the eventual passage of the <b>Tydings-McDuffie Act</b> in 1934, which set the stage
        for full independence in 1946.
        The establishment of the Philippine Senate was a major step toward Filipino self-rule, as it provided a platform
        for more Filipino voices in the political process, while still under the watchful eye of the United States.

    <h3>1934 - Tydings-McDuffie Act</h3>

    <p>
        The <b>Tydings-McDuffie Act</b> of 1934 was a crucial law that set the stage for the establishment of the <b>Commonwealth
        of the Philippines</b> and laid down a structured pathway toward full independence.
        This act formalized a <b>10-year transition period</b>, during which the Philippines would move toward
        self-governance, with the promise of full independence by 1946.

    </p>

    <p>
        A key provision of the Tydings-McDuffie Act was the requirement for the drafting of a new <b>Philippine
        constitution</b>.
        This constitution would lay the foundation for the establishment of the Commonwealth government,
        which would have full control over domestic affairs, except for issues related to defense and foreign policy,
        which would still be overseen by the United States.
        The drafting of the constitution was a significant step in the Philippines’ political maturation,
        as it allowed Filipinos to shape their own future within the framework of an independent nation.

    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to creating a structure for self-rule, the Tydings-McDuffie Act also mandated the establishment of a
        <b>Philippine national government</b> with a President and a national legislature, further solidifying Filipino
        participation in governance.
        The act outlined a clear timeline for the transition to independence, with the goal of granting full sovereignty
        to the Philippines in 1946, marking the end of over four decades of American rule.

    </p>

    <p>
        Although the Tydings-McDuffie Act was a major step toward independence, it also continued U.S.
        influence in the Philippines, particularly in the areas of military and foreign affairs,
        until the country was granted full independence after World War II.

    <h3>1935 - Commonwealth of the Philippines</h3>

    <p>
        The <b>Commonwealth of the Philippines</b> was officially inaugurated on <b>November 15, 1935</b>, with <b>Manuel
        L. Quezon</b> becoming the first President.
        This was a significant milestone in the country's journey toward full independence,
        as the Commonwealth government marked the beginning of a transitional period under the <b>Tydings-McDuffie
        Act</b>, which would culminate in full sovereignty by 1946.

    </p>

    <p>
        Under the Commonwealth government, <b>Quezon’s administration focused on key areas of development</b> to prepare
        the nation for eventual independence. These included:
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>National Defense:</b> Recognizing the importance of self-defense, the Commonwealth
        emphasized building a national defense system. <b>The National Defense Act of 1935</b>
        established the Philippine Army, which was intended to provide for the country’s security in the
        event of foreign threats, particularly in the face of increasing tensions in Asia. This was part of
        the broader effort to ensure that the Philippines could stand independently as a sovereign nation.

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Economic Reforms:</b> The Commonwealth government worked on economic reforms aimed at
        reducing the country’s dependence on the United States. This included attempts to develop
        industries and improve agriculture, as well as creating a more self-sustaining economy. One of
        the most notable moves in this regard was the creation of the National Economic Council, which was tasked with
        creating a strategy for the Philippines' economic growth, focusing on industries
        like sugar, tobacco, and coconut.

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Educational Reforms:</b> Education played a central role in the Commonwealth government’s
        agenda, as it was seen as essential for creating a well-informed citizenry capable of self-rule.
        Quezon’s administration introduced reforms aimed at improving access to education, expanding
        public schools, and ensuring that the Filipino language (Tagalog) was taught alongside English
        to strengthen national identity. The creation of the <b>National Language Institute</b> in 1936 was a
        significant step in promoting the development of a national language, which was an important
        part of building a unified, independent country.

    </p>

    <p>
        Quezon’s leadership during the Commonwealth period set the stage for the Philippines'
        eventual independence by prioritizing defense, economic self-sufficiency, and national unity
        through education. The Commonwealth era was seen as a preparatory phase to help the
        Philippines manage its affairs independently, which culminated in full independence in 1946.

<!--1941–1945 - Japanese Occupation and World War II-->

    <h3>1820s-1890s - Secularization Movement</h3>

    <p>
        The Japanese invasion of the Philippines during World War II marked one of the most harrowing chapters in the
        nation’s history. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Japanese forces rapidly advanced
        through the Philippines, overwhelming the U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) and Filipino troops led by
        General Douglas MacArthur. Despite fierce resistance, the Philippines fell to the Japanese in May 1942.

    </p>

    <p>
        One of the most infamous events during the occupation was the Bataan Death March. After the fall of Bataan in
        April 1942, more than 75,000 American and Filipino soldiers were forced to march approximately 60 miles under
        brutal conditions, resulting in thousands of deaths. The march became a symbol of the inhumane treatment
        prisoners of war suffered during the occupation. Filipino civilians also endured severe hardships, including
        forced labor, food shortages, and widespread atrocities.

    </p>

    <p>
        Meanwhile, Filipino guerrilla fighters played a crucial role in resisting Japanese forces. Operating in the
        jungles and remote areas of the Philippines, these guerrilla groups harassed Japanese soldiers through sabotage,
        ambushes, and intelligence gathering, often coordinating efforts with U.S. forces. The resilience of the
        Filipino resistance was vital in maintaining morale and delaying Japanese control over the archipelago.
    </p>

    <p>
        In October 1944, General MacArthur fulfilled his famous promise, "I shall return," landing on the island of
        Leyte. His return marked the beginning of a pivotal campaign to liberate the Philippines. The Battle of Leyte
        Gulf, fought in October 1944, was one of the largest naval battles in history and resulted in the crippling of
        the Japanese Navy, significantly weakening Japan’s hold on the region.
    </p>

    <p>
        The liberation of the Philippines came with the Battle of Manila in early 1945. While the city was liberated, it
        was severely damaged, with tens of thousands of civilians killed during intense urban fighting. Filipino
        civilians also faced horrific abuses, including sexual slavery, as many were forced into comfort stations by
        Japanese soldiers. The brutalities of occupation left deep scars on the Filipino population and shaped post-war
        policies on reparations and justice.

    </p>

    <p>
        With the final defeat of Japanese forces in the Philippines in 1945, the country began to rebuild from the
        widespread devastation. Manila was left in ruins, and much of the infrastructure was destroyed, but the
        Filipinos’ resilience, aided by the return of American forces, marked the beginning of the nation’s recovery
        from the horrors of war.

    <h3>1946 - Philippine Independence</h3>

    <p>
        On July 4, 1946, the Philippines officially gained full independence from the United States, marking the end of
        nearly 50 years of American rule. The Treaty of Manila, signed in July 1946, formalized this transition, with
        President Manuel Roxas being inaugurated as the first president of the newly established Third Republic of the
        Philippines. The proclamation of independence was a momentous occasion, celebrated as a culmination of the
        Philippines’ long struggle for sovereignty, which had been delayed by the complex dynamics of colonialism and
        war

    </p>

    <p>
        However, while the Philippines achieved political independence, the country’s post-war relationship with the
        United States remained deeply intertwined. Under the Bell Trade Act and the Philippine Trade Act, the
        Philippines faced continued economic dependence on the U.S., with American access to Philippine markets and
        resources still guaranteed. The Military Bases Agreement, signed in 1947, allowed the United States to maintain
        military bases in the Philippines for strategic purposes, cementing its military presence in the region.

    </p>

    <p>
        Despite these enduring connections, the 1946 independence marked the beginning of a new era for the Philippines.
        The country faced significant challenges in rebuilding after the devastation of World War II, but with newfound
        sovereignty, the Filipino people took control of their political future, with Manuel Roxas' administration
        focused on post-war recovery and nation-building.
