                    systems of government, and the encomienda system.
                    Manila became a global trade hub through the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade. However, their rule
                    caused an uprising and discontent due to forced labor and land exploitation.
                    This era saw the rise of Filipino reformers and revolutionaries who fought for freedom, leading to
                    the Philippine Revolution.

    <h3>1521 - Arrival of Magellan</h3>

    <p>
        Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, sailing under the Spanish flag, arrives in the
        Philippines and claims the islands for Spain.
        Magellan lands on Homonhon Island, where he is welcomed by local inhabitants. He later
        establishes alliances with local leaders, including Rajah Humabon of Cebu, converting him and
        others to Christianity.
        This marks the first recorded baptism in the Philippines.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, Magellan's involvement in local disputes proves fatal.
        He assists Humabon in a conflict against Lapu-Lapu, the chieftain of Mactan Island, who resists
        Spanish interference.
        Magellan was killed during <b>the Battle of Mactan</b> on April 27, 1521. His death highlights early
        resistance to colonial rule.
        Despite the expedition's setbacks, it underscores Spain’s interest in the Philippines for its
        strategic location and resources.

    </p>

    <p>
        Magellan’s expedition was part of Spain’s efforts to establish trade routes to Asia and gain
        access to spices and other valuable commodities.
        The Spanish saw the Philippines as a strategic location between Asia and Europe, allowing them
        to control trade between East and West.

    <p>
        Miguel López de Legazpi established the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu.
        Legazpi negotiates alliances and uses blood compacts, such as those with leaders Si Katunaw and Si Gala, to strengthen Spanish influence.
        Cebu became the first European foothold in the Philippines and a base for further expansion.
    </p>

    <p>
        This period also witnesses the introduction of Spanish governance, culture, and religion.
        The settlement in Cebu lays the groundwork for subsequent Spanish colonization efforts,
        with Legazpi employing both diplomacy and military force to secure control.

    <h3>1571 - Founding of Manila</h3>

    <p>
        After defeating Rajah Sulayman, Miguel López de Legazpi declares Manila the capital of the Spanish colony.
        Located at the mouth of the Pasig River, Manila’s strategic position makes it an ideal center for trade and administration.
        It became the hub of the <b>Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade</b>, linking Asia, the Americas, and Europe.
    </p>

    <p>
        Manila grows into a bustling cosmopolitan city, with Spanish authorities fortifying it against external threats such as Chinese pirates and Dutch naval forces.

    <h3>1565 - Catholic Missionary Efforts</h3>

    <p>
        The Spanish missionaries play a pivotal role in the colonization process.
        Orders such as the Augustinians, Franciscans, Jesuits, Dominicans, and Recollects arrive to spread Catholicism.
        They introduce the <b>reduction system</b>, wherein native populations are resettled into organized communities centered around churches.
    </p>

    <p>
        Missionaries also established schools, such as the University of Santo Tomas (1611), and hospitals.
        The propagation of Christian practices becomes a tool for both spiritual conversion and social control.
        Over time, Catholicism is deeply embedded in Filipino culture, with indigenous beliefs and traditions merging with Christian practices.

    <h3>1570 - Encomienda System</h3>

    <p>
        The <b>encomienda system</b> grants Spanish officials (encomenderos) the right to collect tributes from indigenous communities in exchange for protection and religious instruction.
        In practice, the system is rife with abuses, including excessive taxation, forced labor, and land dispossession.
    </p>

    <p>
        These injustices lead to widespread economic hardships and resentment among Filipinos.
        The encomienda system is a precursor to later land-tenure issues that plague the Philippines during the Spanish period and beyond.

    <h3>1600s - Resistance and Revolts</h3>

    <p>
        The Spanish period is punctuated by numerous uprisings, driven by resistance to colonial abuses and loss of indigenous sovereignty. Significant revolts include:
    </p>

    <p>
        - <b> The Tondo Conspiracy (1587–1588)</b>: A failed plot led by noble Filipinos, including Magat Salamat, to overthrow Spanish rule with Japanese support.
        <br>
        - <b>The Dagohoy Rebellion (1744–1829)</b>: The longest rebellion in Philippine history, sparked by Francisco Dagohoy’s grievance over religious and labor abuses in Bohol.

    </p>

    <p>
        These uprisings, though often suppressed, reflect enduring resistance to Spanish domination

    <h3>1762-1764 - British Occupation of Manila</h3>

    <p>
        During <b> the Seven Years’ War </b> , British forces captured Manila and Cavite, exposing the fragility of Spanish colonial defenses.
        The British sought to exploit Spanish vulnerabilities and disrupt their control over key colonies. Although the occupation was short-lived,
        it had significant repercussions.

    </p>

    <p>
        The British allied with local groups dissatisfied with Spanish rule, inspiring uprisings in the provinces.
        Although Spain regained control following the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the occupation highlighted the need for better defenses and governance,
        as well as the growing discontent among Filipinos.

    <h3>Early 1800s - Rise of the Filipino Ilustrado Class</h3>

    <p>
        The opening of Manila to world trade in 1834 marked a turning point in Philippine society.
        Economic growth facilitated the rise of the Ilustrados, an educated Filipino middle class. Many <b>Ilustrados</b>,
        such as José Rizal and Graciano López Jaena, studied abroad, where they were exposed to Enlightenment ideas and liberalism.
        This exposure fostered a sense of nationalism and a desire for reform.

    </p>

    <p>
        The Ilustrados played a key role in advocating for political and social changes, emphasizing education and enlightenment as tools for progress.
        Their efforts laid the foundation for later reformist and revolutionary movements.

    </div>

    <h3>1820s-1890s - Secularization Movement</h3>

    <p>
        The <b>Secularization Movement</b>sought to empower Filipino priests by advocating for their right to lead parishes traditionally dominated by Spanish friars.
        This movement gained momentum in the 19th century, culminating in the <b>Cavite Mutiny of 1872</b>, a revolt against Spanish military policies.
        The mutiny led to the execution of three Filipino priests— <b>Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora (Gomburza)</b>—on charges of subversion.

    </p>

    <p>
        Their execution sparked outrage and galvanized nationalist sentiments, particularly among the Ilustrados. The movement’s legacy influenced later campaigns for equality and independence.

    <h3>1880s - The Propaganda Movement</h3>

        Reformists like <b>José Rizal</b>,<b>Marcelo H. del Pilar</b>, and<b>Graciano López Jaena</b> launched the Propaganda Movement,
        advocating for representation in the Spanish Cortes, freedom of speech, and secularization. Rizal’s novels, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo,
        expose colonial injustices and inspire resistance.

    </p>

    <p>
        The movement’s failure to secure reforms underscores the limitations of peaceful advocacy, leading to revolutionary movements.

    <h3>1896 - Philippine Revolution Begins</h3>

    <p>
        Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, sailing under the Spanish flag, arrives in the
        Philippines and claims the islands for Spain.
        Magellan lands on Homonhon Island, where he is welcomed by local inhabitants. He later
        establishes alliances with local leaders, including Rajah Humabon of Cebu, converting him and
        others to Christianity.
        This marks the first recorded baptism in the Philippines.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, Magellan's involvement in local disputes proves fatal.
        He assists Humabon in a conflict against Lapu-Lapu, the chieftain of Mactan Island, who resists
        Spanish interference.
        Magellan was killed during <b>the Battle of Mactan</b> on April 27, 1521. His death highlights early
        resistance to colonial rule.
        Despite the expedition's setbacks, it underscores Spain’s interest in the Philippines for its
        strategic location and resources.

    </p>

    <p>
        Magellan’s expedition was part of Spain’s efforts to establish trade routes to Asia and gain
        access to spices and other valuable commodities.
        The Spanish saw the Philippines as a strategic location between Asia and Europe, allowing them
        to control trade between East and West.
