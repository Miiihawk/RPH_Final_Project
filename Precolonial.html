          Settlement of early humans in the Philippines, followed later by Austronesians
          who brought farming, pottery, and seafaring skills. People lived in small
          villages called barangays, traded with neighboring countries like China
          and India, and developed their own culture and laws. In Mindanao, Islam spread,
          leading to the creation of sultanates.

  <h3>500,000 BC to 5000 BC - Ancient Settlements</h3>

  <p>
    The earliest human presence in the Philippines dates back approximately 500,000 years,
    as evidenced by the discovery of the fossilized remains of <b>Homo luzonensis</b> in <b>Callao Cave</b>,
    <b>Cagayan</b> in 2019. This new species, distinct from Homo sapiens and Homo erectus, showcases unique features,
    such as curved fingers adapted for climbing, suggesting a blend of arboreal and terrestrial living.
    Other archaeological discoveries, like stone tools in the <b>Rizal, Kalinga excavation site</b>, provide insights
    into early tool-making and hunting practices in the region.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <b>Tabon Caves</b> in Palawan, excavated in the 1960s, revealed some of the earliest human tools
    and remains, including the <b>Tabon Man</b>, estimated to be 22,000 years old. These findings point to
    advanced knowledge of stone tool-making and possibly early forms of communal living.

  <h3>2000 BC to 500 AD - Austronesian Migration</h3>

  <p>
    Around 2000 BC, <b>Austronesian-speaking people</b> from Taiwan began migrating
    to the Philippines via maritime routes. This migration introduced agriculture,
    domesticated animals, and pottery, marking the transition from hunter-gatherer
    societies to agrarian communities. These Austronesians brought a sophisticated
    maritime culture, reflected in the design of <b>balangay boats</b>, which became
    integral to inter-island trade and travel.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Austronesians are also credited with introducing <b>rice cultivation</b>,
    tattooing, weaving, and the early concept of barangay governance.
    Over time, these settlers intermingled with indigenous populations,
    creating a rich tapestry of linguistic, cultural, and genetic diversity.

  <h3>900 AD - Laguna Copperplate Inscription</h3>

  <p>
    Discovered in 1989 near the <b>Lumban River in Laguna</b>, the <b>Laguna Copperplate
    Inscription (LCI)</b> is the oldest written document in the Philippines.
    Dated to 900 AD, the inscription is written in <b>Kawi script</b>, a writing
    system derived from Old Javanese, and reveals a sophisticated society
    with developed legal and trade systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    The text records the forgiveness of a debt owed by a man named Namwaran,
    granted by a ruler in the region of Tondo. It references nearby places such
    as Paila (Bulacan) and Medang (Java), indicating extensive regional trade
    and cultural exchange with neighboring Southeast Asian policies.

  <h3>1000 to 1400 AD - Rise of Barangays and Sultanates</h3>

  <p>
    During this period, <b>barangays</b>, small, independent communities led by a <b>datu</b>
    or chieftain, became the dominant form of governance. These communities,
    typically consisting of 30–100 households, were often located near rivers,
    coasts, or fertile lands. The barangays were social and political units
    based on kinship, trade alliances, and mutual protection.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Mindanao and Sulu, <b>Islam</b> was introduced by Arab and Malay traders around
    the 13th century. By the 14th century, Islam had taken root, leading to the
    establishment of <b>Sultanates</b> in <b>Sulu (1450)</b> and <b>Maguindanao (1515)</b>. These
    sultanates became powerful Islamic centers, with rulers like <b>Sultan Sharif
    ul-Hashim</b> consolidating power and spreading Islamic teachings.

  <h3>10th to 15th Century - Trade with Asian Neighbors</h3>

  <p>
    The Philippines was an active participant in trade networks connecting
    Southeast Asia, China, India, and the Malay Peninsula. Chinese records
    from the <b>Song Dynasty (960–1279)</b> refer to regular trade with the
    “Ma-i” (believed to be Mindoro), which exported beeswax, cotton,
    and gold in exchange for ceramics and silk. Archaeological evidence,
    such as <b>Ming Dynasty</b> ceramics and gold artifacts from Surigao,
    confirms the flourishing trade economy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The discovery of the <b>Butuan Boats</b>, dated to the 4th–13th centuries,
    highlights the region’s advanced shipbuilding skills and its role in
    maritime trade. Butuan was known as a major trading port, particularly
    for its gold, which remains some of the finest ever unearthed in Southeast Asia.
