          Following independence, the Third Republic focused on
          post-war rehabilitation, fostering economic growth,
          and asserting national identity. Efforts included land
          reform and cultural revival, but this era also faced
          political challenges and unrest. These issues ultimately
          led to the declaration of Martial Law in 1972.

  <h3>1946 - Philippine Independence</h3>

  <p>
    On <b>July 4, 1946</b>, the Philippines achieved full sovereignty through
    the <b>Treaty of Manila</b>, formally ending American colonial rule.
    <b>President Manuel Roxas</b>, the first leader of the newly established
    <b>Third Republic</b>, prioritized rebuilding the war-torn nation.
    However, his administration faced significant challenges,
    particularly economic dependency on the United States. <b>The
    Bell Trade Act</b>, enacted as a condition for receiving post-war
    aid, granted Americans equal access to the Philippines' natural
    resources and imposed economic restrictions that limited the
    country's industrialization potential (Agoncillo, 1990, pp. 372–373).

    to maintain strategic bases, including <b>Clark Air Base and Subic

    presence in Southeast Asia, reflecting the geopolitical tensions
    of the early <b>Cold War</b>. Although the bases contributed to local
    economies, they also symbolized continued American influence over
    Philippine sovereignty (Agoncillo, 1990, pp. 373–374).</p>

  <p>
    <b>President Elpidio Quirino</b>'s term was characterized by a

    his administration faced widespread allegations of corruption,
    undermining its legitimacy. During this period, the <b>Hukbalahap
    (Huk) Rebellion</b> gained momentum as peasants demanded land reform
    and an end to rural inequalities. The insurgency posed a
    significant threat to national stability and exposed the
    shortcomings of government policies (Agoncillo, 1990, pp. 374–376).

    rural poverty marked a significant shift in Philippine

    for its limited scope in addressing structural
    economic challenges (Agoncillo, 1990, pp. 377–379).

    declaration effectively ended the <b>Third Republic</b> and ushered
    in an authoritarian regime. Martial Law allowed Marcos to
    consolidate power, suppress dissent, and extend his presidency
    beyond constitutional limits. While his regime promised stability
    and reform, it was marked by widespread human rights abuses,
    economic inequality, and political repression (Agoncillo, 1990, pp. 382–383).
